DESCRIPTION:         creating a baseline run for scientific testing and software consistency checking using rme topo and HRRR data
NOTES:
		     * Much of this repo came from the AWSM tests repo authored by Micah Johnson
				 * DEM was downloaded from ASTER Global DEM via https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/
		     * topo.nc was generated using basin_setup -f raw_data/rme_basin_outline.shp -dm ~/Downloads/ASTGTM2_N43W117/ASTGTM2_N43W117_dem.tif --cell_size 50
		     * The HRRR was downloaded from https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/hrrr/ from the HRRRv3 weather model product
		     * This is designed to be a test and therefore is stripped of a lot of details that might be important to this datas origins
